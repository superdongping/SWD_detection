This folder contains MATLAB code designed to detect both positive and negative SWD peaks from EEG data in the NEX5 format. 
If you have any questions or require further clarification, feel free to reach out to superdongping@gmail.com or ping.dong@duke.edu.
To utilize this code:
1. Begin by loading the data and parameters into the function 'SWD_detection'.
2. Subsequently, employ 'Seizure_idx' to compute the SWD seizure index.
